##Things and Their Attributes##

###Chapter 1: Introduction###

The universe contains **things**.

> For example, _I_, _London_, _roses_, _redness_, _old English books_, _the letter which I received yesterday._

Things have **attributes.**

>For example, _large_, _red_, _old_, _which I received yesterday._

One thing may have many attributes; and one attribute may belong to many things.

>Thus, the thing _a rose_ may have the attributes _red_, _scented_, _full-blown_, etc.; and the attribute _red_ may belong to the things _a rose_, _a brick_, _a ribbon_, etc.

Any attribute, or any set of attributes, may be called an **adjunct.**

>This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant repetition of the phrase *attribute or set of attributes*.

>Thus, we may say that a rose has the attribute _red_ (or the adjunct _red_, whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has the adjunct _red, scented and full-blown._]

###Chapter 2: Classification###

**Classification,** or the formation of classes, is a mental process, in which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain things. Such a group is called a **class**.

This process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:

1. We may imagine that we have put together all things. The class so formed (i.e. the class _things_) contains the whole **universe**.

2. We may think of the class things, and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the things which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class. This adjunct is said to be **peculiar** to the class so formed. In this case, the class things is called a **genus** with regard to the class so formed: the class, so formed, is called a **species** of the class _things_: and its peculiar adjunct is called its **differentia**.

	As this process is entirely mental, we can perform it whether there is, or is not, an existing thing which possesses that adjunct. If there is, the class is said to be **real**; if not, it is said to be **unreal**, or **imaginary**.

	> For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the class *things*, all the things which possess the adjunct *material*, *artificial*, *consisting of houses and streets*; and we may thus form the real class *towns*. Here we may regard *things* as a genus, *towns* as a species of things, and *material*, *artificial*, *consisting of houses and streets* as its differentia.

	Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the things which possess the adjunct *weighing a ton*, *easily lifted by a baby*; and we may thus form the imaginary class *things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby*.

3.  We may think of a certain class, not the class *things*, and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the **members** of it which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class. This adjunct is said to be *peculiar* to the smaller class so formed. In this case, the class thought of is called a genus with regard to the smaller class picked out from it: the smaller class is called a *species* of the larger: and its peculiar adjunct is called its differentia.

	> For example, we may think of the class _towns_, and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the attribute _lit with gas_; and we may thus form the **real class** _towns lit with gas_. Here we may regard _towns_ as a genus, _towns lit with gas_ as a species of towns, and _lit with gas_ as its differentia.
	
	> If, in the above example, we were to alter _lit with gas_ into _paved with gold_, we should get the imaginary class _towns paved with gold_.
	
A class, containing only one member is called an **individual**.

> For example, the class _towns having four million inhabitants_, which class contains only one member, for example _London_.

Hence, any single thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other things, may be regarded as a **one-member class**.

> Thus *London* may be regarded as the one-Member class, picked out from the class towns, which has, as its differentia, _having four million inhabitants_.

A class, containing two or more members, is sometimes regarded as one single thing. When so regarded, it may possess an adjunct which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately.

> Thus, the class _the soldiers of the Tenth Regiment_, when regarded as one single thing, may possess the attribute _formed in square_, which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately.
