###Chapter 3: Division###

####Section 1: Introduction####

Division is a mental process, in which we think of a certain class of things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller classes.

> Thus, we might think of the class _books_, and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller classes _bound books_ and _unbound books_, or into the three classes, _books priced at less than a shilling_, _shilling-books_, _books priced at more than a shilling_, or into the twenty-six classes, _books whose names begin with A_, _books whose names begin with B_, and so on.

A class, that has been obtained by a certain division, is said to be **codivisional** with every class obtained by that division.

> Thus, the class _bound books_ is codivisional with each of the two classes, _bound books_ and _unbound books_.

> Similarly, the *Battle of Waterloo* may be said to have been contemporary with every event that happened in 1815.

Hence a class, obtained by division, is codivisional with itself.

> Thus, the class *bound books* is codivisional with itself.

> Similarly, the *Battle of Waterloo* may be said to have been contemporary with itself.

####Section 2: Dichotomy####

If we think of a certain class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller class, it is evident that the remainder of the large class does not possess the differentia of that smaller class. Hence it may be regarded as another smaller class, whose differentia may be formed, from that of the class first picked out, by prefixing the word *not*; and we may imagine that we have divided the class first thought of into two smaller classes, whose differentiæ are contradictory. This kind of division is called **dichotomy**.

> For example, we may divide _books_ into the two classes whose differentiæ are *old* and *not-old*.

In performing this process, we may sometimes find that the attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide which of the things belong to the one class and which to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary rule, as to where the one class should end and the other begin.

> Thus, in dividing *books* into *old* and *not-old,* we may say *Let all books printed before 1801*, be regarded as ‘*old*,’ and all others as ‘*not-old*’.

Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a class of things be divided into two classes, whose differentiæ have contrary meanings, each differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word *not* prefixed.

Thus, if *books* be divided into *old* and *new* the attribute *old* is to be regarded as equivalent to *not-new*, and the attribute *new* as equivalent to *not-old*.

After dividing a class, by the process of dichotomy, into two smaller classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller classes; and this process may be repeated over and over again, the number of classes being doubled at each repetition.

> For example, we may divide books into old and new (i.e. not-old): we may then sub-divide each of these into English and foreign (i.e. not-English), thus getting four classes, for example:

> 1. old English;
2. old foreign;
3. new English;
4. new foreign.

> If we had begun by dividing into *English* and *foreign*, and had then sub-divided into old and new, the four Classes would have been

> 1. English old;
2. English new;
3. foreign old;
4. foreign new.

> The reader will easily see that these are the very same four classes which we had before.
