##Things and Their Attributes##

###Chapter 4: Names###

The word *thing*, which conveys the idea of a thing, without any idea of an adjunct, represents any single thing. Any other word (or phrase), which conveys the idea of a thing, with the idea of an adjunct represents any thing which possesses that adjunct; i.e., it represents any member of the class to which that adjunct is peculiar.

Such a word (or phrase) is called a **name**; and, if there be an existing thing which it represents, it is said to be a name of that thing.

> For example, the words *thing*, *treasure*, *town*, and the phrases *valuable thing*, *material artificial thing consisting of houses and streets*, *town lit with gas*, *town paved with gold*, *old English book*.

Just as a class is said to be real, or unreal, according as there is, or is not, an existing thing in it, so also a name is said to be real, or unreal, according as there is, or is not, an existing thing represented by it.

> Thus, *town lit with gas* is a real name: *Town paved with gold* is an unreal name.

Every name is either a substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a substantive and one or more adjectives (or phrases used as adjectives).

Every name, except thing, may usually be expressed in three different forms:

1. The substantive *thing*, and one or more adjectives (or phrases used as adjectives) conveying the ideas of the attributes;

2. A substantive, conveying the idea of a thing with the ideas of some of the attributes, and one or more adjectives (or phrases used as adjectives) conveying the ideas of the other attributes;

3. A substantive conveying the idea of a thing with the ideas of all the attributes.

	> Thus, the phrase *material living thing, belonging to the animal kingdom, having two hands and two feet* is a name expressed in form 1.

	> If we choose to roll up together the Substantive thing and the adjectives *material, living, belonging to the animal kingdom*, so as to make the new substantive animal, we get the phrase *animal having two hands and two feet*, which is a name (representing the same thing as before) expressed in form 2.

	> And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so as to make the new substantive *man*, we get a name (still representing the very same thing) expressed in form 3.

A name, whose substantive is in the plural number, may be used to represent either

1. Members of a class, regarded as separate things; or 
2. A whole class, regarded as one single thing.

	> Thus, when I say *some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are tall*, or *the soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave*, I am using the name *soldiers of the Tenth Regiment* in the first sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of them separately, and to say *this soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall*, *that soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall*, and so on.
	
	> But, when I say *the soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed in square*, I am using the phrase in the second sense; and it is just the same as if I were to say *the Tenth Regiment is formed in square*.
