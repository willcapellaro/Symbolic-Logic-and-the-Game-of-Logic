###Chapter 2: Propositions of Existence###

A **proposition of existence**, when in normal form, has, for its subject, the class **existing things**.

Its sign of quantity is **some** or **no**.

> Note that, though its sign of quantity tells us how many existing things are members of its predicate, it does not tell us the exact number: in fact, it only deals with two numbers, which are, in ascending order, 0 and 1 or more.

It is called **a proposition of existence** because its effect is to assert the reality (ie, the real existence), or else the imaginariness, of its predicate.

> Thus, the proposition *some existing things are honest men* asserts that the class *honest men* is real.

> This is the normal form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:

> 1. _Honest men exist_;
1. _Some honest men exist_;
1. _The class honest men exists_;
1. _There are honest men_;
1. _There are some honest men_.

> Similarly, the proposition no existing things are men fifty feet high asserts that the class men 50 feet high is imaginary.

> This is the normal form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:

> 1. _Men 50 feet high do not exist_;
1. _No men 50 feet high exist_;
1. _The class men 50 feet high does not exist_;
1. _There are not any men 50 feet high_;
1. _There are no men 50 feet high._
