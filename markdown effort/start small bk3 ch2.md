###Chapter 2: Counters###

Let us agree that a black counter, placed within a cell, shall mean that cell is **occupied,** i.e., “there is at least one thing in it”).

Let us also agree that a white Counter, placed on the partition between two cells, shall mean that compartment, made up of those two cells, is occupied; but it is not known whereabouts, in it, its occupants are. Hence it may be understood to mean at least one of those two cells is occupied: possibly both are.

Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind which of two political parties he will join: such a man is said to be *sitting on the fence*. This phrase exactly describes the condition of the black counter.

Let us also agree that a white counter, placed within a cell, shall mean that Cell is empty, i.e., there is nothing in it.

Counters will appear in, or next to diagrams, and can be repositioned in most web browsers. To return a diagram to its initial state, hit the reset button.
